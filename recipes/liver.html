        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>2 pounds sliced beef liver.</li>
                <li>Â¼ cup butter, divided.</li>
                <li>2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into ringsy.</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste.</li>
             </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Step 1</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gently rinse liver slices under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Place in a shallow dish; pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions, or set aside for longer if you have time. Soaking will remove any bitterness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><em>Step 2</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion rings; cook and stir in butter until tender and soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions into a bowl and set the skillet aside.</li>
                    </ul>   
                </li>
                <li><em>Step 3</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place flour on a plate; season with salt and pepper. Drain milk from liver and coat liver slices in flour mixture.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><em>Step 4</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet; increase heat to medium-high and fry coated liver slices until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Return onions to the skillet and reduce heat to medium; continue to cook until onions are heated through and liver is slightly pink inside, or longer to suit your taste.</li>
                    </ul>      
                </li>
            </ol>
